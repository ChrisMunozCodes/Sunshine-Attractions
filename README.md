## ü§î How to contribute

If you would like to contribute to this project please reach out to me via discord: chriscodes

**Follow the steps below**

```bash
0. Leave a comment on the issue you would like to work on 

1. Fork the original repository (top right corner next to watch and star buttons)

2. Under the dropdown menu from the button "code" copy the HTTPS link (from your forked repository) 'https://github.com/(your username)/Sunshine-attractions.git'

3. In the place you want to clone the project, use git clone (your https link here)

4. Once you have the project open in VSCODE use 'git remote add upstream  https://github.com/ChrisMunozCodes/Sunshine-attractions.git' in the terminal, this will track the main repository 

5. You can now use 'git fetch upstream' in the terminal to see a list of the different branches.

6. Use 'git checkout -b branch-name' replace branch-name with your branch. This will create a new branch for you to work within

7.. You can now use git add . & git commit -m '' 

8. Use 'git push -u origin a-descriptive-branch-name' replace a-descriptive-branch-name with your branch name (this will push all your code)

9. Now go back to your github and a button will appear that prompts you to make a pull request
